### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Pirateness, a student studying C#, JS, Python and a whole host of other languages!

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a super secret video game project in my spare time
- âš¡ I use VSCode for pretty much everything, ex-Atom user
- ğŸ“« I hate poorly written code, and theres no better place to find that than my old respositories (maybe one day I'll go back and fix my 12 year old self's projects)
- ğŸŒ± My favourite language is C#, but my most used one is probably JS
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started coding Minecraft plugins with Java in Eclipse at 8 years old
- ğŸ’¬ If your interested in contacting me, please do so here: notpirateness@gmail.com
